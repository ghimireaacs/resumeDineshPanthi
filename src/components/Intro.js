                    In 1992, I earned my master's degree in pure mathematics from the Central Department of Mathematics at Tribhuvan University in Nepal. Afterwards, I began teaching at an affiliated college of the university. Two years later, I became a permanent lecturer of mathematics at Nepal Sanskrit University. <br /><br />

                    In 2009, I completed my M.Phil. degree from Kathmandu University. Four years later, under the guidance of Professor Dr. Kanhaiya Jha from Kathmandu University, I earned my Ph.D. degree in the field of fixed point theory.<br /><br />
                    Currently, I hold the position of Associate Professor of Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics at Valmeeki Campus, Nepal Sanskrit University. I have supervised half a dozen Ph.D. students from the same institution and have served as a subject expert for them. <br /><br />

                    Over the years, I have authored over three dozen research articles in prestigious international journals, as well as some books published by international publishers. I have organized a national mathematics conference and have served as a committee member for various international conferences, workshops, and seminars. I have also worked as a reviewer, managing editor of a journal, and chief editor of proceedings of national conferences. I am a lifetime member of organizations like Nepal Mathematical Society, Nepal Red Cross Society, Mathematical Sciences Trust, Nepal, and Nepal Scout. <br /><br />

                    I have had the privilege of delivering research talks at international mathematical conferences held in countries like Nepal, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Indonesia, Turkey, and Australia.
